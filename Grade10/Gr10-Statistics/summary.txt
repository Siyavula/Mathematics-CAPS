Statistics: Summarise data

How?
  Go from many numbers (individual data) to a few.

Why?
  Easier to interpret
  Want to highlight important aspects of the data
  Figure
     Side-by-side images of two datasets that are from same
     distribution but individual datapoints are different. Make point
     that the summary is closer to what we're interested in than the
     individual datapoints.

Challenges

  Need to determine which aspects are important and which ones are not
  since we're throwing away information. Don't want to throw away
  important information.

-----

Need summary figure of different statistics -- preferably to highlight
how they are the same and how they are different. Classic example:
mode v mean v median.

Need to make the point that the most probably value isn't necessarily
typical.
