Hi Carl

Stats chapter

I thought a bit about the maths and I think the best contribution
would be help on the Stats chapter since there is a strong link
between the Stats and Probability and also that you are very familiar
with Stats.

Even if you can do a rough outline or write certain sections and we
take it where you left off. Currently it is the only chapter we
haven't written or looked at. The rest has been written and I put
Marina and Alison to check Helen's chapters and vice versa.

- I attach the comparison which states the CAPS requirement, the
  publisher's table of contents and our table of contents.

- The first two files is a very roughs shuffle I did of pieces when
  comparing to the publishers and you can choose to use or completely
  disregard it.

- in the next mail I'll send the old version of the chapter which is
  the current Github LaTeX version to work from. The exercises and
  diagrams and data sets may be useful.

Let talk tomorrow.

Thanks and good luck there with the uploading.

Regards
Neels
