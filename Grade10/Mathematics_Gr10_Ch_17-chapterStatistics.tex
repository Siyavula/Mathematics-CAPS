      \label{m39403*id199946}Information in the form of numbers, graphs and tables is all around us; on television, on the radio or in the newspaper. We are exposed to crime rates, sports results, rainfall, government spending, rate of HIV/AIDS infection, population growth and economic growth.\par 
      
      \label{m39403*eip-765}This chapter demonstrates how Mathematics can be used to manipulate data, to represent or misrepresent trends and patterns and to provide solutions that are directly applicable to the world around us.
\par \label{m39403*id199957}Skills relating to the collection, organisation, display, analysis and interpretation of information that were introduced in earlier grades are developed further.\par

          \label{m39403*id200337}Data refers to the pieces of information that have been observed and recorded, from an experiment or a survey. There are two types of data: primary and secondary. The word "data" is the plural of the word "datum", and therefore one should say, "the data are" and not "the data is". \par 
           } 
      \end{tabular*}
      \end{definition}

          \label{m39403*id200350}Data can be classified as \textsl{primary} or \textsl{secondary}, and primary or secondary data can be classified as \textsl{qualitative} or \textsl{quantitative}. Figure~16.1 summarises the classifications of data.\par

            \label{m39403*uid4}
            \item[Primary data:]
          describes the original data that have been collected. This type of data is also known as \textsl{raw} data. Often the primary data set is very large and is therefore summarised or processed to extract meaningful information.
\label{m39403*uid5}
            \item[Qualitative data:]
          is information that cannot be written as numbers, for example, if you were collecting data from people on how they feel or what their favourite colour is.
\label{m39403*uid6}
            \item[Quantitative data:]
          is information that can be written as numbers, for example, if you were collecting data from people on their height or weight.
\label{m39403*uid7}
            \item[Secondary data:]
          is primary data that has been summarised or processed, for example, the set of colours that people gave as favourite colours would be secondary data because it is a summary of responses.
\end{itemize}
        
          \label{m39403*id200459}Transforming primary data into secondary data through analysis, grouping or organisation into secondary data is the process of generating information.\par 
        
        \label{m39403*uid8}
            \subsubsection{ Purpose of Collecting Primary Data}
            \nopagebreak
            
          
          \label{m39403*id200473}Data is collected to provide answers that help with understanding a particular situation. Here are examples to illustrate some real world data collections scenarios in the categories of qualitative and quantitative data.\par 
        
        \label{m39403*id200480}
            \subsubsection{ Qualitative Data}
            \nopagebreak
            
          
          \label{m39403*id200486}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m39403*uid9}\item The local government might want to know how many residents have electricity and might ask the question: "Does your home have a safe, independent supply of electricity?"
\label{m39403*uid10}\item A supermarket manager might ask the question: ``What flavours of soft drink should be stocked in my supermarket?" The question asked of customers might be ``What is your favourite soft drink?'' Based on the customers' responses (i.e. which flavours are chosen), the manager can make an informed decision as to what soft drinks to stock.
\label{m39403*uid11}\item A company manufacturing medicines might ask ``How effective is our pill at relieving a headache?'' The question asked of people using the pill for a headache might be: ``Does taking the pill relieve your headache?'' Based on responses, the company learns how effective their product is.
\label{m39403*uid12}\item A motor car company might want to improve their customer service, and might ask their customers: ``How can we improve our customer service?''
\end{itemize}
        
        
        \label{m39403*id200551}
            \subsubsection{ Quantitative Data}
            \nopagebreak
            
          
          \label{m39403*id200557}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m39403*uid13}\item A cell phone manufacturing company might collect data about how often people buy new cell phones and what factors affect their choice, so that the cell phone company can focus on those features that would make their product more attractive to buyers.
\label{m39403*uid14}\item A town councillor might want to know how many accidents have occurred at a particular intersection, to decide whether a robot should be installed. The councillor would visit the local police station to research their records to collect the appropriate data.
\label{m39403*uid15}\item A supermarket manager might ask the question: ``What flavours of soft drink should be stocked in my supermarket?" The question asked of customers might be ``What is your favourite soft drink?'' Based on the customers' responses (i.e. the number of customers who liked soft drink A), the manager can make an informed decision as to what soft drinks to stock. 
\end{itemize}
        
          \label{m39403*id200605}However, it is important to note that different questions reveal different features of a situation, and that this affects the ability to understand
the situation. For example, if the first question in the list was re-phrased to be: "Does your home have electricity?" then if you answered yes, but you were getting your electricity from a neighbour, then this would give the wrong impression that you did not need an independent supply of electricity.\par 
        
      
      \label{m39403*uid16}
            \subsubsection{ Methods of Data Collection}
            \nopagebreak
            
        
        \label{m39403*id200621}The method of collecting the data must be appropriate to the question being asked. Some examples of data collecting methods are:\par 
        \label{m39403*id200626}\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{\arabic*}. ] 
            \label{m39403*uid17}\item Questionnaires, surveys and interviews
\label{m39403*uid18}\item Experiments
\label{m39403*uid19}\item Other sources (friends, family, newspapers, books, magazines and the Internet)
\end{enumerate}
        
        \label{m39403*id200664}The most important aspect of each method of data collecting is to clearly formulate the question that is to be answered. The details of the data collection should therefore be structured to take your question into account.\par 
        \label{m39403*id200670}For example, questionnaires, interviews or surveys would be most appropriate for the list of questions in "Purpose of Collecting Primary Data" (Section~16.1.2.1.2: Purpose of Collecting Primary Data).\par 
      
      \label{m39403*uid20}
            \subsubsection{ Samples and Populations}
            \nopagebreak
            
        
        \label{m39403*id200688}Before the data collecting starts, it is important to decide how much data is needed to make sure that the results give an accurate reflection to the required answers. Ideally, the study should be designed to maximise the amount of information collected while minimising the effort. The concepts of \textsl{populations} and \textsl{samples} is vital to minimising effort.\par 
        \label{m39403*id200705}The following terms should be familiar:\par 
        \label{m39403*id200708}\begin{description}[noitemsep]
            \label{m39403*uid21}
            \item[Population:]
          describes the entire group under consideration in a study. For example, if you wanted to know how many learners in your school got the flu each winter, then your population would be all the learners in your school.
\label{m39403*uid22}
            \item[Sample:]
          describes a group chosen to represent the population under consideration in a study. For example, for the survey on winter flu, you might select a sample of learners, maybe one from each class.
\label{m39403*uid23}
            \item[Random sample:]
          describes a sample chosen from a population in such a way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
\end{itemize}

        \par 
        \label{m39403*id200766}Choosing a representative sample is crucial to obtaining results that are unbiased. For example, if we wanted to determine whether peer pressure affects the decision to start smoking, then the results would be different if only boys were interviewed, compared to if only girls were interviewed, compared to both boys and girls being interviewed.\par 
        \label{m39403*id200773}Therefore questions like: "How many interviews are needed?" and "How do I select the candidates for the interviews?" must be asked during the design stage of the sampling process.\par 
        \label{m39403*id200777}The most accurate results are obtained if the entire population is sampled for the survey, but this is expensive and time-consuming. The next best method is to \textsl{randomly} select a sample of subjects for the interviews. This means that whatever the method used to select subjects for the interviews, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. There are various methods of doing this for example, names can be picked out of a hat or can be selected by using a random number generator. Most modern scientific calculators have a random number generator or you can find one on a spreadsheet program on a computer.\par 
        \label{m39403*id200791}So, if you had a total population of 1 000 learners in your school and you randomly selected 100, then that would be the sample that is used to conduct your survey.\par

However, an average of 10 loaves must be an exact match to the mass stipulated. - Sunday Tribune of 10 October 2004 on page 10"\par

      \label{m39400*id211153}Once the data has been collected, it must be organised in a manner that allows for the information to be extracted most efficiently. For this reason it is useful to be able to summarise the data set by calculating a few quantities that give information about how the data values are spread and about the central values in the data set. Other methods of summarising and representing data will be covered in grade 11.\par

          \label{m39400*id211176}The mean, (also known as arithmetic mean), is simply the arithmetic average of a group of numbers (or data set) and is shown using the bar symbol \hspace{1ex} \begin{math}\overline{}\end{math}. So the mean of the variable \begin{math}x\end{math} is \begin{math}\overline{x}\end{math} pronounced "x-bar". The mean of a set of values is calculated by adding up all the values in the set and dividing by the number of items in that set. The mean is calculated from the raw, ungrouped data.\par

      {tip: }
     An easy way to determine the central position or positions for any ordered data set is to take the total number of data values, add 1, and then divide by 2. If the number you get is a whole number, then that is the central position. If the number you get is a fraction, take the two whole numbers on either side of the fraction, as the positions of the data values that must be averaged to obtain the median.

        \label{m39400*id212665}The mean, median and mode are measures of central tendency, i.e. they provide information on the central data values in a set. When describing data it is sometimes useful (and in some cases necessary) to determine the spread of a distribution. Measures of dispersion provide information on how the data values in a set are distributed around the mean value. Some measures of dispersion are range, percentiles and quartiles.\par

      \label{m39403*id207418}One of the first steps to processing a large set of raw data is to arrange the data values together into a smaller number of groups, and then count how many of each data value there are in each group. The groups are usually based on some sort of interval of data values, so data values that fall into a specific interval, would be grouped together. The grouped data is often presented graphically or in a frequency table. (Frequency means ``how many times'')\par

            \nopagebreak
            \label{m39400*eip-839}We can summarise a data set by using the five number summary. The five number summary gives the lowest data value, the highest data value, the median, the first (lower) quartile and the third (higher) quartile. Consider the following set of data: 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7, 3, 6, 9, 4, 5. We first order the data as follows: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9. The lowest data value is 2 and the highest data value is 9. The median is 5. The first quartile is 4 and the third quartile is 6. So the five number summary is: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9. 
\par \label{m39400*eip-504}
            \subsubsection{ Box and whisker plots}
            \nopagebreak
            \label{m39400*eip-148}The five number summary can be shown graphically in a box and whisker plot. The main features of the box and whisker diagram are shown in Figure~16.4. The box can lie horizontally (as shown) or vertically. For a horizonatal diagram, the left edge of the box is placed
at the first quartile and the right edge of the box is placed at the third quartile. The height of
the box is arbitrary, as there is no y-axis. Inside the box there is some representation of central
tendency, with the median shown with a vertical line dividing the box into two. Additionally, a
star or asterix is placed at the mean value, centered in the box in the vertical direction. The
whiskers which extend to the sides reach the minimum and maximum values. This is shown for the data set: 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7, 3, 6, 9, 4, 5.

\label{m39400*eip-405}We can apply the concepts of mean, median and mode to data that has been grouped. Grouped data does not have individual data points, but rather has the data organized into groups or bins. To calculate the mean we need to add up all the frequencies and divide by the total. We do not know what the actual data values are, so we approximate by choosing the midpoint of each group. We then multiply those midpoint numbers by the frequency. Then we add these numbers together to find the approximate total of the masses. The modal group is the group with the highest frequency. The median group is the group that contains the middle terms.\par \label{m39400*eip-151}Measures of dispersion can also be found for grouped data. The range is found by subtracting the smallest number in the lowest bin from the largest number in the highest bin. The quartiles are found in a similar way to the median.\par \label{m39400*secfhsst!!!underscore!!!id2004}\vspace{.5cm}

        \label{m39400*id215169}To calculate the mean we need to add up all the masses and divide by 50. We do not know actual masses, so we approximate by choosing the midpoint of each group. We then multiply those midpoint numbers by the frequency. Then we add these numbers together to find the approximate total of the masses. This is show in the table below.\par

%             \label{m39404*eip-910}
% All measurements have some error associated with them. Random errors occur in all data sets and are sometimes known as non-systematic errors. Random errors can arise from estimation of data values, imprecision of instruments, etc. For example if you are reading lengths off a ruler, random errors will arise in each measurement as a result of estimating between which two lines the length lies. Bias is also sometimes known as systematic error. Bias in a data set is where a value is consistently under or overestimated. Bias can arise from forgetting to take into account a correction factor or from instruments that are not properly calibrated (calibration is the process of marking off predefined measurements).

            \nopagebreak
            \label{m39404*eip-493}Many people take statistics and just blindly apply it to life or quote it. This, however, is not wise since the data that led to the statistics also needs to be considered. A well known example of several sets of data that lead to the same statistical analysis (the process of examining data and determining values such as central tendency, etc.) but are in fact very different is Anscombe's quartet. This is shown in . In Grade 11 you will learn about the methods used to represent data graphically. For now, however, you should simply appreciate the fact that we can plot data values on the Cartesian plane in a similar way to plotting graphs. If each of the datasets in Anscombe's quartet are analysed statistically, then one finds that the mean, variance, correlation and linear regression (these terms will be explained in later grades) are identical. If, instead of analysing the data statistically, we simply plot the data points we can see that the data sets are very different. This example shows us that it is very important to consider the underlying data set as well as the statistics that we obtain from the data. We cannot simply assume that just because we know the statistics of a data set, we know what the data set is telling us. For general interest, some of the ways that statistics and data can be misinterpreted are given in the following extension section.

      \label{m39404*id215969}In many cases groups can gain an advantage by misleading people with the misuse of statistics. Companies misuse statistics to attempt to show that they are performing better than a competitor, advertisers abuse statistics to try to convince you to buy their product, researchers misuse statistics to attempt to show that their data is of better quality than it really is, etc.\par 
      \label{m39404*id215973}Common techniques used include:\par 
      \label{m39404*id215979}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m39404*uid105}\item Three dimensional graphs.

\label{m39404*uid107}\item Axes without scales.
\label{m39404*uid108}\item Graphic images that convey a negative or positive mood.
\label{m39404*uid109}\item Assumption that a correlation shows a necessary causality.
\label{m39404*uid110}\item Using statistics that are not truly representative of the entire population.
\label{m39404*uid111}\item Using misconceptions of mathematical concepts
\end{itemize}
        
      \label{m39404*id216070}For example, the following pairs of graphs show identical information but look very different. Explain why.\par
