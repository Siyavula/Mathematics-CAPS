{ \Large
Mathematics is commonly thought of as being about numbers but mathematics is actually a language! Mathematics is the language that nature speaks to us in. As we learn to understand and speak this language, we can discover many of nature’s secrets. Just as understanding someone’s language is necessary to learn more about them, mathematics is required to learn about all aspects of the world -- whether it is physical sciences, life sciences or even finance and economics.\par


The great writers and poets of the world have the ability to draw on words and put them together in
ways that can tell beautiful or inspiring stories. In a similar way, one can draw on mathematics to
explain and create new things. Many of the modern technologies that have enriched our lives are
greatly dependent on mathematics. DVDs, Google searches, bank cards with PIN numbers are just
some examples. And just as words were not created specifically to tell a story but their existence enabled
stories to be told, so the mathematics used to create these technologies was not developed for its own sake,
but was available to be drawn on when the time for its application was right.\par


There is in fact not an area of life that is not affected by mathematics. Many of the most sought after
careers depend on the use of mathematics. Civil engineers use mathematics to determine how to best
design new structures; economists use mathematics to describe and predict how the economy will react
to certain changes; investors use mathematics to price certain types of shares or calculate how risky
particular investments are; software developers use mathematics for many of the algorithms (such as
Google searches and data security) that make programmes useful.\par



But, even in our daily lives mathematics is everywhere – in our use of distance, time and money.
Mathematics is even present in art, design and music as it informs proportions and musical tones. The
greater our ability to understand mathematics, the greater our ability to appreciate beauty and
everything in nature. Far from being just a cold and abstract discipline, mathematics
embodies logic, symmetry, harmony and technological progress. More than any other language,
mathematics is everywhere and universal in its application.\par

{\Large
\textbf{\textit{Everything Maths}} is not just a Maths textbook. It has everything you expect from
your regular printed school textbook, but comes with a whole lot more. For a start, you can download or read it
on-line on your mobile phone, computer or iPad, which means you have the convenience of accessing
it wherever you are.\par


We know that some things are hard to explain in words. That is why every chapter comes with links to online video
lessons and explanations which help bring the ideas and concepts to life. Summary presentations at
the end of every chapter offer an overview of the content covered, with key points highlighted for easy
revision.\par


All the exercises inside the book link to a online service where you can get more practice, see the full solution
or test your skills level on mobile and PC.\par


We are interested in what educators and learners think, wonder about or struggle with as you read through the book and
attempt the exercises. That is why we made it possible for educators and learners to use their mobile phones or computers to access the books online
digitally pin a question to a page and see what questions and answers other readers pinned up too.\par


This book is the same one used by Mindset Learn in their new television broadcast, where experienced educators work through it, explain the concepts and work out exercises from the book.

Learn and the Khan Academy that help bring the ideas and concepts on the page to life. Learners can now get extra insight, detailed
explanations and worked examples, while also seeing the concepts in action and hearing real people talk about how they use maths and science in their work!  \par

This is a great way for you to bring technology into your classroom – using a projector or digital whiteboard, access the books on \underline{www.everythingmaths.co.za} and use the videos to provide an additional summary of the concepts you have covered by offering an alternative explanation. After hours, learners that need additional help will know that they can watch the videos in their own time, with the added bonus of being able to stop, pause and rewind the explanation until they have fully grasped the concept. This is great for revision purposes too, as it is like having a personal teacher on hand for every learner, at any time! \par

{\Large
Monassis can be accessed at: \underline{http://www.monassis.com/}.\par 

Siyavula offers an open online assessment bank called Monassis, for the sharing and accessing of curriculum-aligned test and exam questions with answers. All the questions and solutions found in the textbook are hosted on-line on Monassis. In addition to this, this site enables educators to quickly set tests and exam papers, by selecting items from the library and adding them to their test. Educators can then download their separate test and memo which is ready for printing. Monassis further offers educators the option of capturing their learners' marks in order to view a selection of diagnostic reports on their performance.\par 

To begin, you need to a create a free account by clicking on “sign up now” on the landing page. There is one piece of administration you need to do to get started properly: when you log in for the first time, click on your name on the top right. It will take you to your personal settings. You need to select Shuttleworth Foundation as your metadata organisation to see the curriculum topics.\par

% {\normalfont\sffamily\fontsize{16}\normalfont\itshape  How do I do Each of These?}\par 
% \textbf{Share and access questions}\par 
% Sharing questions: use either the online editor or OpenOffice template which can be downloaded from the website (Browse questions → Contribute questions → Import questions). Take your test/worksheet/other question source. Break it up into the smallest sized individual questions that make sense, and use the template style guide to style your page according to question/answer. Upload these questions or type them up in the online editor (Browse questions → Contribute questions → Add questions). Do not include overall question numbering but do include sub numbering if needed (e.g. 1a, 2c, etc.). Insert the mark and time allocation, tag questions according to grade, subject i.e. a description of the question, and then select the topics from the topic tree. Finalise questions so that they can be used in tests and accessed by other Monassis users.\par 
% 
% Accessing questions: there are three ways to access questions in the database. Click on “Browse questions” → click on the arrow to the left of the grade, which opens out the subjects → keep clicking on the arrows to open the learning outcomes or, following the same process, instead of clicking on the arrow, click on the grade → now you can browse the full database of questions for all the subjects in that grade or, from the landing page, click on “Browse questions” → below the banner image click on “Find Questions” → search by topics, author (if you know a contributor), text or keywords e.g. Gr10 mathematics functions and graphs. \par 
% 
% \textbf{Create tests from questions
% }\par 
% So, you have all these bits of tests (i.e. many questions!), but what you really want is the actual test. How do you do this? Well, you can simply click “add to test” on any question and then click on the “Tests” tab at the top right of the page, and follow the simple instructions. Alternatively you can create a test by starting with clicking on that same “Tests” tab, and add questions to your test that way. Once done, simply print off the PDF or Word file of the questions, issue your test, collect them once complete, and mark them using the memo provided by Monassis. \par 
% 
% \textbf{Create class lists}\par 
% 
% But now you are asking, how can I keep track of my classes? Is Johnny Brown in class A or B? Well, you can make a class list by clicking on the “Class lists” tab at the top right of the page, and either import a CSV file, or manually enter the relevant information for each class. Now you can issue tests  to your classes, and have a class list for each class. And what about capturing their marks?\par 
% 
% \textbf{Create scoresheets}\par 
% For each test you can create a scoresheet. Select the “Tests” tab at the top right, click on “Marks” below the banner image, and select the test and follow the instructions to input their marks. You can then export these as a CSV file for use in spreadsheets.\par 
% 
% \textbf{Analyse learners' performance}\par 
% 
% And finally, you can print out reports of class performance. Click on “Reports” at the top right of the page, which opens various reports you can view. There are reports to see class performance, learner performance, class performance per topic, class performance per question, learner strengths and weaknesses, and learner progress.\par 
% So now you know how Monassis works, we encourage you to make use of its simple functionality, and let it help you save time setting tests and analysing learner marks!\par

{\normalfont\sffamily\fontsize{22}\normalfont\itshape Practice and test your skills} \par

One of the best ways for learners to prepare for tests and exams is to practice answering the same kind of questions they will be tested on. At every set of exercises you will see a practice icon and short-code, which link to an online database for learners to practice further exercises. Point your learners at \underline{www.everythingmaths.co.za} on their mobile phone or PC. where they can enter the short-code from the textbook into the box on the website, and be redirected to additional exercises online. This on-line practice on mobile and PC will keep track of learners' performance and progress, give them feedback on areas which require more attention, and suggest which sections or videos to look at.\par

The software can generate any number of questions with the same structure but different details i.e. the numerical values in physics or maths problems can change each time, but the type of question can stay the same. This allows much more variety than a traditional question bank - to the extent that a different practice test can be created automatically for each student in a class. The system also generates a memorandum along with each test, and tracks the learners' conceptual understanding through their success at answering different types of questions.\par
Monassis aims to discover the strong and weak points in learners' understanding as the learners are going through worked examples and drilling exam problems. By knowing with which concepts learners are struggling, the system can then do useful things like
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item provide more practice on the types of questions with which the learner is struggling;
\item recommend revision material from freely available educational resources (for example,  Siyavula's Everything Maths and Everything Science textbooks);
\item provide feedback and reports to learners, educators and parents about their progress and about the specific concepts to which they should pay more attention.
\end{itemize}
 The above is done for each learner individually, delivering a customised practice and revision schedule to match his or her pace and understanding.

{\normalfont\sffamily\fontsize{22}\normalfont\itshape Ask questions and find answers} \par

{\Large
If a learner is stuck on a particular section of work in the textbook, they can get additional help by visiting \underline{www.everythingmaths.co.za} on their phone or computer, and find out if other learners also had a question about that same section of the work. If a question has been posted, educators can go on-line and respond, thereby helping other learners that may have been stuck on the same problem. \par


Using the short-codes at section headings and exercises in the textbook, learners can go to the above website, enter the short-code into the box on-line, and be redirected to the relevant place in the book. Once there they can pin their question at the exact spot where it cropped up (see image below), by highlighting a specific section of the text. They will be able to see whether the question has been asked before by other learners, and what the given answer to that question is. \par
